# DiseasePredictingSystem
A project wehere we use clustering algorithms on patient symptoms and predict a disease from commonly occurring diseases.

## Progress
1. Login authentication
2. Split into 2 apps(users and crux-predictions)
4. Modify inputs to dropdowns from radio buttons
5. Make DB model to store data and predictions
6. Messages(alerts) integration
7. Sign up made
8. Admin setup complete

## Tasks left
1. Better integrate prediction algorithms

#### Note: Will require Posgres DB setup as in 'settings.py'
#### Note: Jupyter Notebook of our algoritms is kept as 'Prediction system.ipynb'
